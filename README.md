## Overview
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since I've been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this assignment, I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, I will perform: Data Engineering & Data Analysis.
